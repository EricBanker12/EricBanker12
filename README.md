### Hi, I am Eric Banker ðŸ‘‹

Initially I pursued a career in biology research, but due to personal circumstances, I changed focus toward software development. I have been programming as a hobby since 2014 and have specialized in full stack web development through recent projects and employment. I have strong technical depth in JavaScript, C#, and Python ecosystems, and as a Software Developer, I aim to contribute to the progress of modern healthcare and the enjoyment of technology.
