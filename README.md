### Hi, I am Eric Banker ðŸ‘‹

Initially I pursued a career in biology research, but switched to technology due to personal concerns. I have been programming as a hobby since 2014, and have over 3 years experience with JavaScript and Node.js. Over the last year, I have dedicated myself to building responsive front ends, REST-ful back ends, automated testing, and working on remote, cross-functional teams with Agile Scrum methodology.

I am Eric Banker, a Full Stack Web Developer. My dream is to make meaningful contributions to the technology of healthcare, research, and entertainment.

Currently working on: [Flap with Friends](https://github.com/EricBanker12/flap-with-friends)
